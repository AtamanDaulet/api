BigInteger class is used for mathematical operation which involves very big integer calculations 
that are outside the limit of all available primitive data types.
For example factorial of 100 contains 158 digits in it so we can’t store it in any primitive data type available.
We can store as large Integer as we want in it.
There is no theoretical limit on the upper bound of the range because memory is allocated dynamically 
but practically as memory is limited you can store a number which has Integer.
